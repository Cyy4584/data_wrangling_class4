```{r set up}
library(tidyverse)
```
# Import the litter data
```{r import}
litter_df = read_csv("./data_import_examples/FAS_litters.csv")
litter_df = janitor::clean_names(litter_df)
```
# 'Select' some columns but not others

different usages of 'select' function:
- select columns by name
```{r}
select(litter_df, group, litter_number)
select(litter_df, -group)
select(litter_df, group:gd18_weight)
```
- Rename columns:
one  change and select, the other one change but keep others.
```{r}
select(litter_df, GROUP = group, LITTER_NUMBER = litter_number)

rename(litter_df, GROUP = group, LITTER_NUMBER = litter_number)
```
- select columns by condition / select helpers
the last two examples represent the same function but the different expressions.
```{r}
select(litter_df, starts_with("gd"))
select(litter_df, litter_number, everything())
relocate(litter_df, litter_number)
```
